# Foxppuccin
Stonch &amp; Steadfast, Firefox murky grey colour, style and functional layout focused theme with minor white highlights and sprinkles on top. This is not a firefox based theme, at least that's what I tell myself, but I swear, it has its own feel. This theme provides both a colour scheme but also makes changes to layouts and functions of programs. These are easy to tell apart and you can leave out what you don't want. Use at your own ricing woes.\
Currently supported programs:
- Firefox (no changes needed currently)
- Polybar (wip)
- Rofi (wip)
- GTK+ (wip)
- Kitty
